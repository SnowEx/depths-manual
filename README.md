# depths-manual repo
This repository has scripts to process manually collected snow depths and depth profiles collected during the NASA SnowEx field campaigns (2017-2023)

# organization 
There are up to four main directories organized by SnowEx field campaign year: SnowEx2017, SnowEx2020, SnowEx2021, and SnowEx2023, hereinafter referred to as S17, S20, S21, and S23.

# SnowEx (brief) background: 
| Year | Campaign Type | Measurement Focus |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| 2017 | IOP           | Colorado, focused on multiple instruments in a forest gradient. |
| 2020 | IOP, TS       | Western U.S focused on Time Series of L-band InSAR, active/passive microwave for SWE and thermal IR for snow surface temp. |
| 2021 | TS            | Western U.S, continued Time Series of L-band InSAR, also addressed prairie & snow albedo questions. |
| 2023 | IOP           | Alaska Tundra & Boreal forest, focused on addressing SWE/snow depth and albedo objectives. |

*IOP = Intense Observation Period (~2-3 week, daily observations); TS = Time Series (~3-5 month winter, weekly observations)*
